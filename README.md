# icsi424-computer-security-labs
A collection of lab write-ups and code for UAlbany's Computer Security course.

This work is based on SEED Labs, covering these domains and topics:

  *Software Security: Set-UID programs and environment variables, Buffer Overflow, and Format String Vulnerability

  *Web Security: Cross-site Request Forgery and Cross-site Scripting

  *Network Security: Packet sniffing and spoofing, TCP attacks, and DNS attacks.

Race Conditions and SQL Injections were not covered in the course, but the labs are still available on SeedLabs. I will work on them on my own time, along with additional labs
